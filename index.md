Hello! This is the website where I collect all of my fictional writings, from short stories to poems.  
Ever since the beginning of middle school, I enjoyed writing as a minor passtime. I would often write small and silly stories in a journal or notebook, and even when writing for assignments or essays given out at school, I felt more at ease then when I had to do math or history homework. It wasnt until highschool that writing became something I aspired to be good at. Ever since I have enjoyed commiting myself to projects both small and large, and hope to eventually have the opportunity to publish a book of my own. I hope that as more stories and writings get added to this website, my gradual improvements will become more evident. Each writing will also have a short corresponding explanation for my thought process behind writing it. Thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy what I've presented here for you.
