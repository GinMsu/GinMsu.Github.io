There it was at the center  
Floating,  
A blue, bleeding pool of  
Dust, converging  
Matter incarnate.  
In a void.  

Houses that lined the road for miles and no one was outside.  
Anything scarier than being alone?”  
There was no one to answer but the dust.  
And, clearing my throat, I asked my question: “Is there  
one who was not born to live here?”  
I entered a house with people inside, closed the door,  
Yet, a voice spoke,”Among you, was there  

“A boon. Destined to be taken for granted. Sought, prayed after dearly. A boon is good.”  
Empty words had been passed from mouth to ear, shared in repetition like a virus,  
But these words rang true to me. We were so desperate to get one foot ahead,  
Then one foot behind. One foot ahead, then one foot behind. I only walk  
Forward now, down a broad, abandoned road. Only dust walks with me now.  
Where is my boon? Mother, father, where is my boon? This sickly road  
Is my reprise and my only oracle. Looking up I saw  
Earth.
